Evaluation Metrics Used in the Heart Disease Prediction Project
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Accuracy
   - Proportion of correctly classified instances among all instances.

2. Precision (weighted)
   - Weighted average precision across all classes.
   - Precision = TP / (TP + FP).
   - High precision means fewer false positives.

3. Recall (weighted)
   - Weighted average recall across all classes.
   - Recall = TP / (TP + FN).
   - High recall means fewer false negatives.

4. F1-score (weighted)
   - Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
   - Provides a balance between precision and recall.
   - Useful when classes are imbalanced.

5. ROC AUC (One-vs-Rest, multi-class)
   - Area under the ROC curve, averaged using the OvR strategy.
   - Measures the ability of the model to discriminate between classes.

6. Confusion Matrix
   - Tabular visualization of actual vs predicted classes.
   - Shows classification performance across classes.

7. Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) [for clustering]
   - Measures similarity between clustering results and ground-truth labels.
   - Adjusted for chance; ranges from -1 to 1.
   - 1 = perfect clustering, 0 = random assignment.
